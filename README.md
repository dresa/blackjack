Blackjack program with a GUI that follows RAY rules to every detail (in Finnish).

A screenshot of the program in action:

The game of Blackjack that follows exactly the rules that RAY (Raha-automaattiyhdistys) uses
in Finland, including splits, insurances, and doubling. In developing phase,
I even went as far as asking the game hosts about the finest details,
just to get it right.

This is an early school project I did when I first learnt programming with
Java version 1.4. Considering this was my first programming project,
I was happy with the result -- and still am. Nowadays I'd make quite a many
things differently, but I decided to keep the project untouched,
just the way it was in 2003.

Everything in the program is in Finnish, even the source code.
